  <h2 id="so_what_is_accessibility">So what is accessibility?</a></h2>
  <div style="background-color:cadetblue">
    <p>Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.&nbsp;We traditionally
      think of this as being about people with disabilities, but&nbsp;the practice of making sites accessible also
      benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.</p>

    <p>You might&nbsp;also think of accessibility as treating everyone the same, and giving them
      equal&nbsp;opportunities, no matter what their ability or circumstances. Just as it is wrong to exclude someone
      from a physical building because they are in a wheelchair (modern public buildings generally have wheelchair ramps
      or elevators), it is also not right to exclude someone from a website because they have a visual impairment. We
      are all different, but we are all human, and therefore have the same human rights.</p>

    <p style="background-color:darkolivegreen">Accessibility is the right thing to do. Providing accessible
      sites&nbsp;is&nbsp;part of the law in some
      countries, which&nbsp;can open up some significant markets that otherwise would not&nbsp;be able to use your
      services or buy your products.</p>

    <p>Building accessible sites benefit everyone:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility,&nbsp;also improves SEO, making your site more findable.</li>
      <li>Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.</li>
      <li>Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as
        mobile phone users or those on low network speed. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such improvements.
      </li>
      <li>Did we mention it is also the law in some places?</li>

  <p>An accessible product is one that is usable by all, and assistive technology is a general term for devices or
    techniques that can aid access, typically when a disability would otherwise preclude it. For example, captions give
    deaf and hard of hearing people access to video, but things get more interesting when we ask what counts as a
    disability.
  </p>
  <p>On the ‘social model’ definition of disability adopted by the World Health Organization, a disability is not an
    intrinsic property of an individual, but a mismatch between the individual’s abilities and environment. Whether
    something counts as a ‘disability’ or an ‘assistive technology’, doesn’t have such a clear boundary and is
    contextual.
  </p>
  <p>Addressing mismatches between ability and environment has lead to not only technological innovations but also to
    new understandings of how humans perceive and interact with the world.</p>

  <h2>Skip to content testing</h2>
  <div id="content" role="main">
    <h4>People with visual impairments</h4>
    <p>People with visual impairments include people with blindness, low-level vision, and color blindness. Many people
      with visual impairments use screen magnifiers that are either physical magnifiers or software zoom capabilities.
      Most browsers and operating systems these days have zoom capabilities. Some users will rely on screen readers,
      which is software that reads digital text aloud. Some screen reader examples include:
    </p>

    <h4>People with hearing impairments</h4>
    <p>Otherwise known as people with auditory impairments or deaf people, this group of people has either low hearing
      levels or no hearing at all. Hearing-impaired people do use ATs (see Assistive Devices for People with Hearing,
      Voice, Speech, or Language Disorders), but there are not really special ATs specific for computer/web use.

      There are, however, specific techniques for providing textual alternatives to audio content which range from
      simple text transcripts to text tracks (i.e., captions) that can be displayed along with video. An article, later
      on, will discuss these.

      Hearing-impaired people also represent a significant userbase — "466 million people worldwide have disabling
      hearing loss", says the World Health Organization's Deafness and hearing loss fact sheet.
    </p>

    <h4>People with mobility impairments</h4>
    <p>These people have disabilities concerning movement, which might involve purely physical issues (such as loss of
      limb or paralysis), or neurological/genetic disorders that lead to weakness or loss of control in limbs. Some
      people might have difficulty making the exact hand movements required to use a mouse, while others might be more
      severely affected, perhaps being significantly paralyzed to the point where they need to use a head pointer to
      interact with computers.

      This kind of disability can also be a result of old age, rather than any specific trauma or condition, and it
      could also result from hardware limitations — some users might not have a mouse.

      The way this usually affects web development work is the requirement that controls be accessible by the keyboard —
      we'll discuss keyboard accessibility in later articles in the module, but it is a good idea to try out some
      websites using just the keyboard to see how you get on. Can you use the Tab key to move between the different
      controls of a web form, for example? You can find more details about keyboard controls in our Cross browser
      testing Using native keyboard accessibility section.

      In terms of statistics, a significant number of people have mobility impairments. The US Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention Disability and Functioning (Non-institutionalized Adults 18 Years and Over) reports the USA
      "Percent of adults with any physical functioning difficulty: 16.1%".
    </p>

    <h4>People with cognitive impairments</h4>
    <p>Cognitive impairment refers to a broad range of disabilities, from people with intellectual disabilities who have
      the most-limited capabilities, to all of us as we age and have difficulty thinking and remembering. The range
      includes people with mental illnesses, such as depression and schizophrenia. It also includes people with learning
      disabilities, such as dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Importantly, though there is a lot of
      diversity within clinical definitions of cognitive impairments, people with them experience a common set of
      functional problems. These include difficulty with understanding content, remembering how to complete tasks, and
      confusion caused by inconsistent webpage layouts.
